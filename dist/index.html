						<h3 class="content-title">Meeting system</h3>
						<p> The development of a system to control monthly meetings and other functionalities related to
							it. Users could make a checkout of their attendance using the barcode printed on their ID.
						</p>
						<p>It was developed using PHP with MYSQL as a database, with JQuery</p>
					</section>
					<section class="content">
						<h3 class="content-title">ERP Development</h3>
						<p>Development of a micro ERP to a family business, it will control all the sales made. Nowadays
							the system is under reformulation to fit
							other business requisites, for example, stock and orders management, reducing administrative
							costs (time and money).</p>
						<p>It will help to calculate revenue, earns, EBITDA, among other financial indicators.</p>
						<p>The First version was developed with procedural PHP, to be able to do real time features, it
							is being build with NodeJS, using Sequelize.js as ORM.</p>

					<section class="content">
						<h3 class="content-title">IV Tecnologia em foco fair. - Institucional website - UNICAMP</h3>
						<p>
							Developed with wordpress, its main goal was to show the lectures schedule, so students could
							check and plan themselves, also it worked as a photos archive. Project developed with
							Andr&eacute; Matulionis dos Santos. You can check the website <a
								href="http://www.ft.unicamp.br/IVtecnologiaemfoco/">Here</a>.

						<h3 class="content-title">Converting Courseviewer to the WEB envieroment.</h3>
						<p>This project is being built to my TCC (project to end the major) with the goal to convert the
							current version of Courseviewer (Java Desktop) to a WEB version, so more people could have
							access to it, because to use the current version, it requires you to install JVM.</p>
						<p>CourseViewer is a tool which helps coordinators, students and professors understand majors
							plannings, the entire major, delivering clear and centralized information. If the user needs
							to find all the required information, he/she would have to access different pages on the
							university website, have a few tabs on her/his browser, which is pretty difficult. A
							missunderstood information can cause a lot of problems on the student's life.</p>
						<p>Its being built with a partnership with Andr&eacute; Matulionis dos Santos, which is
							responsible to build the front-end of the application.</p>
						<p>Me on the other hand, i am responsible to build all the rest endpoints, structure the
							database tables, make all the queries and make sure that all the information that the view
							layer requires is available.</p>
						<p>Because this project aims to have contribution in the future, the main goal is to have an app
							with a clear code, clear file structure and easier to maintain, different from the desktop
							version. I also created contribution guides and policies, so the code will maintain clean
							and organized.</p>
						<p>It's being build with Laravel (Using passport and some other packages), PostgreSQL and D3 to
							be able to draw all the nodes and graphs.</p>
